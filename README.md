# *Ae.aegypti* RNAseq data collection

This repository contains an analysis workflow to process Ae. aegypti RNAseq data that is available through the Sequencing Read Archive (SRA). The current workflow uses RNAseq data from the following studies:

* [Akbari *et al*. (2013)](http://www.g3journal.org/content/3/9/1493) "The Developmental Transcriptome of the Mosquito *Aedes aegypti*, an Invasive Species and Major Arbovirus Vector"
* [Alfonso-Parra *et al*. (2016)](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004451) "Mating-Induced Transcriptome Changes in the Reproductive Tract of Female *Aedes aegypti*"
* [Matthews *et al*. (2016)](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-015-2239-0) "The neurotranscriptome of the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito"
